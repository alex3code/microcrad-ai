The function tanh is define within the Value class. it is a hyperbolic tangent function that is used to calculate the value of the function at a given point. The tanh function is defined as follows:

def tanh(self):
        x = self.data
        t = (math.exp(2 * x) - 1) / (math.exp(2 * x) + 1)
        out = Value(t, (self, ), 'tanh')
        return out

self.data means the value of the function at a given point. The tanh function is calculated using the formula t = (exp(2 * x) - 1) / (exp(2 * x) + 1), where exp is the exponential function. The output of the tanh function is stored in the out variable, which is an instance of the Value class. The out variable is then returned as the result of the tanh function.

t is the value of the tanh function at a given point x. The tanh function is used to calculate the value of the function at a given point x. The tanh function is defined as follows:

out is an instance of the Value class that stores the value of the tanh function at a given point x. The out variable is then returned as the result of the tanh function.

math.exp is the exponential function in the math module. It is used to calculate the exponential value of a given number.
